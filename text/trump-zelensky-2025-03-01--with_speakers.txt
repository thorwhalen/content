[Trump]: Well, thank you very much.
[Trump]: It's an honor to have President Zelensky of Ukraine.
[Trump]: And we've been working very hard, very close.
[Trump]: So we've actually known each other for a long time.
[Trump]: We've been dealing with each other for a long time and very well.
[Trump]: We had little negotiations, but that worked out great.
[Trump]: I think for both countries, I think for the world, actually, beyond both countries.
[Trump]: And we have something that is a very fair deal.
[Trump]: And we look forward to getting in and digging, digging, digging and working and getting some of the rare earth.
[Trump]: But it means we're going to be inside and it's a big commitment from the United States and we appreciate working with you very much.
[Trump]: And we will continue to do that.
[Trump]: We have had
[Trump]: some very good discussions with Russia.
[Trump]: I spoke with President Putin, and we're going to try and bring this to a close with something that you want and that he wants.
[Trump]: We have to negotiate a deal.
[Trump]: But we've started the confines of a deal, and I think something can happen.
[Trump]: The big thing is the number of
[Trump]: Soldiers mostly at this point, but soldiers being killed, they're losing thousands of soldiers.
[Trump]: So, on both sides, we're losing a lot of soldiers.
[Trump]: And we want to see it stop.
[Trump]: And we want to see the money get put to different kinds of use, like rebuilding, the rebuilding.
[Trump]: And we're going to be working very hard.
[Trump]: But we've had a lot of very good conversations.
[Trump]: I will say, until we came along, the Biden administration didn't speak to Russia whatsoever.
[Trump]: They didn't speak to anybody.
[Trump]: They just allowed this to continue.
[Trump]: And I will say that I'll say in front of you, you've heard me say it a thousand times, if I were President, this war would have never happened.
[Trump]: We would have had a deal negotiated for you without having to go through what you've gone through.
[Trump]: But you – your soldiers have been unbelievably brave.
[Trump]: We've given them great equipment, but they've – somebody has to use the equipment.
[Trump]: They've been unbelievably brave.
[Trump]: And we give them great credit.
[Trump]: This was supposed to be over very quickly.
[Trump]: And here we are three years later.
[Trump]: So I give tremendous credit to your generals and your soldiers and yourself in the sense that it's been very hard fighting, very tough fighting.
[Trump]: They have great fighters.
[Trump]: And you have to be very proud of them from that standpoint.
[Trump]: But now we want to get it over with.
[Trump]: It's enough, right, if we want to get it over with.
[Trump]: So it's an honor to have you here.
[Trump]: Thank you very much for coming.
[Trump]: We're going to sign the agreement at the conference in the East Room in a little while, right after lunch.
[Trump]: And we'll be having lunch together.
[Trump]: We're also discussing some other things.
[Trump]: And we appreciate everybody being here.
[Trump]: It's a somewhat of an exciting moment.
[Trump]: But the really exciting moment is when they stop the shooting and we end up with a deal.
[Trump]: And I think we're fairly close to getting that and an honor to have you.
[Trump]: And please, would you like to say something?
[Zelenskyy]: Thank you so much, Mr. President.
[Zelenskyy]: Thank you for your invitation.
[Zelenskyy]: And really, I hope that this
[Zelenskyy]: document will be first step to real security guarantees for Ukraine, our people, our children.
[Zelenskyy]: I really count on it.
[Zelenskyy]: And of course, we count that America will not stop support.
[Zelenskyy]: Really, for us, it's very important to
[Zelenskyy]: support and to continue it.
[Zelenskyy]: I want to discuss it with details further during our conversation and of course the infrastructure or security guarantees because for today I understand what Europe is ready to do and of course I want to discuss with you what the United States will be ready to do and I really count on your strong position to stop Putin and
[Zelenskyy]: And you said that enough with the war.
[Zelenskyy]: I think that is very important, Vin, to say these wars to Putin at the very beginning.
[Zelenskyy]: At the very beginning of war because he is a killer and terrorist.
[Zelenskyy]: But I hope that together we can stop him.
[Zelenskyy]: But for us it's very important to, you know, to save our country, our values.
[Zelenskyy]: our freedom and democracy and of course no compromises with the killer about our territories but it will be later and of course I what I wanted you know we spoke about it by phone with you about the trans production we have very good trans production I think the best one in the world for today because of the war
[Zelenskyy]: Yes, and of course we need very much the air defense.
[Zelenskyy]: You have the best air defense in the world, and really you helped us under attacks of Russians, and I want to speak how we can exchange the licenses.
[Zelenskyy]: We're open to share the licenses, so follow our drones with you, of course, with the United States, and we need licenses for quick production.
[Zelenskyy]: Even after the war, we need our nation to be calm, that we are secure.
[Zelenskyy]: That's why we need this air shield.
[Zelenskyy]: And of course, about this, I want to speak about the contingents.
[Zelenskyy]: I think that France and the UK already spoke to you, and we know that Europe is ready, but without the United States, they will not be ready to be as strong as we need.
[Zelenskyy]: And then the last point was not least about exchange, about our people and children.
[Zelenskyy]: And you know that this crazy Russian that they stolen 20,000 of children.
[Zelenskyy]: Ukrainian children, they changed their names, they changed their, you know, their families, relatives, and now they're in Russia.
[Zelenskyy]: We want to bring them back.
[Zelenskyy]: And really, it's a big, big dream, task and goal for me, and our warriors.
[Zelenskyy]: We, by the way, we brought, we exchanged, we released more than 4,000 warriors from Russian prison, but there are thousands.
[Zelenskyy]: more in the prison.
[Zelenskyy]: I wanted to share with you some images.
[Zelenskyy]: Can I now have some minutes?
[Zelenskyy]: One minute.
[Zelenskyy]: One minute.
[Zelenskyy]: Adjust you to understand in what circumstances, in what situation they are, and what the attitude of Russia to our prisons.
[Zelenskyy]: That, guys, just you before and after.
[Zelenskyy]: you see before and after just you to understand now thousands of such guys ladies and men there and that so they don't eat they beat them and they you know a lot of a lot of
[Zelenskyy]: You know, bad things.
[Zelenskyy]: So out of, even during the war, there are rules.
[Zelenskyy]: Everybody knows there are rules during the war.
[Zelenskyy]: These guys, they don't have any rules.
[Zelenskyy]: You see that.
[Zelenskyy]: 50, 60 kilograms left.
[Zelenskyy]: And a lot of such things.
[Zelenskyy]: And I didn't want to show you what the changes were, images of children, because I will share, just share with you.
[Zelenskyy]: I mean, it's looking.
[Zelenskyy]: tragic stuff stuff yeah I wanted very much to give you you see yeah this is pastor by the way they stolen pastors because it's not Russian church they stolen pastors and move pastors to the prison we at the end of last year we've we brought three pastors we could exchange them this is pastor you see
[Zelenskyy]: I wanted to show you this, so thank you very much.
[Zelenskyy]: We want to get that ended, right?
[Zelenskyy]: Yeah, of course.
[Trump]: I think we will.
[Trump]: I think we will.
[Trump]: And I have to, of course.
[Trump]: Do you have any questions, please?
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER_16]: How much money is the U.S.
[SPEAKER_16]: going to put into the fund that is being created today?
[SPEAKER_16]: And how does this provide long-term security for Ukraine?
[Trump]: Well, we don't know exactly how much, because we're going to be putting some money in a fund that we're going to get from the raw earth that we're going to be taking.
[Trump]: sharing in terms of revenue.
[Trump]: So it's going to be a lot of money will be made from the sale and from the use of raw earth.
[Trump]: And as you know, our country doesn't have much raw earth.
[Trump]: We have a lot of oil and gas, but we don't have a lot of the raw earth.
[Trump]: And what we do have is protected by the environmentalists, but that could be unprotected.
[Trump]: But still, it's not very much.
[Trump]: They have
[Trump]: among the best in the world in terms of Roar.
[Trump]: So we're going to be using that take in it, using it for all of the things we do, including AI and including weapons and the military.
[Trump]: And it's really going to very much satisfy our needs.
[Trump]: So it's something that just worked out really well.
[Trump]: We have a lot of oil and we have a lot of gas.
[Trump]: We have a lot, but we don't have Roar.
[Trump]: So this
[Trump]: This has just about every component of the raw earth that we need for computers, for all of the things we do.
[Trump]: This puts us in great shape.
[SPEAKER_16]: And on long-term security, free grant.
[Trump]: How does this go by?
[Trump]: I think they're going to have great luck.
[Trump]: I think once we make the agreement, that's going to be 95 percent of it.
[Trump]: They're not going to go back to fighting.
[Trump]: I've spoken with President Putin, and I think I mean, I feel very strong.
[Trump]: I've known him for a long time, and I feel very strongly that they're very serious about it.
[Trump]: And we'll make a deal.
[Trump]: And when the deal is made, I don't think — we talk about security.
[Trump]: Everyone was talking about the other day — all they talked about was security.
[Trump]: I said, let me make the deal first.
[Trump]: I have to make the deal first.
[Trump]: I don't worry about security right now.
[Trump]: I got to — we have to have a deal.
[Trump]: Because right now, last week, 2,000 soldiers died — on both sides — 2,000.
[Trump]: And they're losing 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 a week.
[Trump]: So as we sit here and we talk, people are getting shot and dying on the battlefield.
[Trump]: And, you know, they're not American soldiers, but they're Russian soldiers and they're Ukrainian soldiers, and we want to be able to stop it.
[Trump]: And we want to be able also to spend money on other things.
[Trump]: We don't want to — this is a tremendous amount of money.
[Trump]: And what the Biden administration did was terrible.
[Trump]: They were giving money, but he had no security on the money.
[Trump]: Europe, as you know, gave much less money, but they had security.
[Trump]: It was in the form of a loan.
[Trump]: They get their money back, and we didn't.
[Trump]: And now, at least, we're protected because the American taxpayer has to be protected, too.
[Trump]: But
[Trump]: This is an incredible agreement for Ukraine, because we have a big investment in their country now.
[Trump]: And what they have, very few people have.
[Trump]: And we're able to really go forward with very, very high-tech things and many other things, including weaponry, weaponry that we're going to use in many locations, but that we need for our country.
[Trump]: Mr. President, this allows us to do this.
[Trump]: Mr. President, will you continue?
[Trump]: Yes, go ahead, please.
[Zelenskyy]: If I can, just that.
[Zelenskyy]: Yes.
[Zelenskyy]: In the document, there is one of the very important points.
[Zelenskyy]: If we speak about business and investment, we never had LNG terminals in Ukraine.
[Zelenskyy]: This document will open.
[Zelenskyy]: I mean, the next document, but anyway, here we see in the framework, we see a really good will for this.
[Zelenskyy]: LNG terminals for us is very important, and I think for security of European continent.
[Zelenskyy]: We have the biggest storage, gas storage.
[Zelenskyy]: We have the biggest in Europe, yes.
[Zelenskyy]: Yes, and we can use it.
[Zelenskyy]: You can use it for LNG, use it for LNG, and we will do it.
[Zelenskyy]: And really, we can help Europe, because Europe really helped.
[Zelenskyy]: President Trump said that they made less support.
[Zelenskyy]: They have our friends and they are our very supportive partners.
[Zelenskyy]: They really gave a lot.
[Zelenskyy]: They really did.
[Trump]: They gave a lot but they gave much less.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr President Trump, you have repeatedly called the deal with Ukraine as a historical one.
[SPEAKER_11]: And as a president of the United States, you make historical decisions in other issues which affect America and other world.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what place in the world history do you want to take?
[SPEAKER_11]: And do you associate yourself with any famous historical figures?
[Trump]: I'd say George Washington, Abraham Lincoln.
[Trump]: I would say I'm far superior to George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.
[Trump]: Now, you know I'm only kidding, right?
[Trump]: Because when I say that, the fake news is going to go wild.
[Trump]: They're going to say he considers himself to be better than Washington.
[Trump]: But you never know.
[Trump]: You never know.
[Trump]: I don't compare myself to anybody.
[Trump]: I'm here to do a job.
[Trump]: We've had a great 35 days or whatever it might be, a month, a little more than a month.
[Trump]: We've accomplished tremendous amounts.
[Trump]: Not only this, this would be a very great achievement if we could get the war stopped and get them back to normalization.
[Trump]: I think that's going to happen.
[Trump]: We've had very good talks on both sides, as you know.
[Trump]: I think we've done a very good job.
[Trump]: Just generally, if you look at all of the things we've done in 30 days, they're saying there's never been an opening for a precedent of the first month.
[Trump]: There's never been a first month like we've had.
[Trump]: And this is one of the very important things.
[Trump]: This to me is one of the most important things because
[Trump]: We have tremendous death taking place as we speak.
[Trump]: And I don't want to have that.
[Trump]: You know, think of the parents, think of the parents, whether they're in Russia or Ukraine, think of the parents of all these people being killed needlessly.
[Trump]: They came to all of us.
[Trump]: Should have never started.
[Trump]: This would have, if I were president,
[Trump]: This would have never started.
[Zelenskyy]: Mr. President, we will continue sending military aid to Ukraine after the U.S.
[Zelenskyy]: signed this agreement with Ukraine.
[Zelenskyy]: The question to President Zelensky, do you feel like the U.S.
[Zelenskyy]: is on your side, that President Trump is on your side at this moment?
[Trump]: What do you think?
[Trump]: He wants to know, do you think that sort of a stupid question?
[Trump]: I guess we wouldn't be here if I wasn't.
[Zelenskyy]: I think that the United States, on our side from the very beginning of occupation,
[Zelenskyy]: And I think that President Trump on our side and, of course, I'm not sure that the United States, the President, will not stop support.
[Zelenskyy]: This is crucial for us.
[Zelenskyy]: It's important for us, yes.
[Zelenskyy]: And Putin, the President speaks about the people and the soldiers which are dying, but they came to our territory.
[Zelenskyy]: They came to our land.
[Zelenskyy]: They began this war, and they have to stop.
[Zelenskyy]: And I think this is the question with really the most important question.
[Zelenskyy]: Can President Trump, I hope yes, with some other allies to stop Putin withdraw these enemies, our enemies, withdraw these troops from our land?
[Zelenskyy]: And I think that you asked about the history.
[Zelenskyy]: I think that if President Orwell, he will stop Putin.
[Zelenskyy]: If President Trump will bring peace to our country, I think he will be.
[Zelenskyy]: on this wall.
[Trump]: We've had very, very good talks.
[SPEAKER_12]: President Zelensky just said there would be no compromises with Vladimir Putin.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to ask both of you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Firstly, are there compromises that you think that President Zelensky is going to have to make?
[SPEAKER_12]: President Zelensky, is there anything that you might be thinking that you may be able to offer, ring the table, for example, elections?
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[Trump]: I think you're going to have to always make compromises.
[Trump]: You can't do any deals without compromises.
[Trump]: So, certainly, he's going to have to make some compromises, but hopefully they won't be as big as some people think you're going to have to make.
[Trump]: That's all.
[Trump]: That's all we can do.
[Trump]: I'm here as an arbitrator, as a mediator, to a certain extent, between two parties that have been very hostile.
[Trump]: To put it mildly, they've been very hostile.
[Trump]: There's been a vicious war.
[Trump]: There's been a vicious war.
[Trump]: You know, it's a very level battlefield.
[Trump]: And those bullets go out.
[Trump]: And as I've said many times, we're talking about it with Pete.
[Trump]: Many times, the only thing stopping those bullets is a human body.
[Trump]: And in the case we're talking about, generally, young human bodies are stopping a lot of bullets.
[Trump]: It's dead level.
[Trump]: That's why it's great farmland.
[Trump]: It's great land.
[Trump]: It's great farmland.
[Trump]: But there's very little protection against the bullets that are being — and other things that are being shot.
[Trump]: So all I can do is see if I can get everybody at the table and get an agreement.
[Trump]: And I think we're going to end up with an agreement.
[Trump]: Otherwise, I wouldn't probably be even here today.
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, I've got two questions for you.
[SPEAKER_13]: You think ultimately your legacy will be the peacemaker and not the President that led this country into another war and ended foreign wars?
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've got a question.
[Trump]: I hope it will.
[Trump]: I mean, I hope I'm going to be
[Trump]: remembered as a peacemaker.
[Trump]: This is, this would be a great thing if we could do this.
[Trump]: I'm doing this to save lives more than anything else.
[Trump]: Second is to save a lot of money, but I've considered that to be far less important.
[Trump]: So I hope I'm going to thank you, Brian, for that question.
[Trump]: It was a nice question.
[Trump]: I hope I'll be known and recognized as a peacemaker.
[Trump]: This would be a great thing to solve.
[Trump]: This is a very dangerous situation.
[Trump]: You know, this could lead to a Third World War.
[Trump]: This is, this was headed in the wrong direction.
[Trump]: If this election were lost, if we didn't win this election, and we won it by a lot, that was a mandate.
[Trump]: We won every swing state.
[Trump]: We won the popular vote by millions and millions of votes.
[Trump]: We won everything.
[Trump]: The districts, if you look at the areas of red, take a look at a map.
[Trump]: This was a big mandate, and this was one of the things.
[Trump]: I said, we're going to get this thing settled.
[Trump]: If we didn't win, I think this could have very well ended up in a Third World War, and that would not have been a good situation.
[Trump]: What was your second question?
[SPEAKER_13]: My second question is for President Zelensky.
[SPEAKER_13]: Why don't you wear a suit?
[SPEAKER_13]: You're the highest level in this country's office, and you refuse to wear a suit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just want to see if you own a suit?
[Zelenskyy]: Yeah, yeah, problems.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of Americans have problems with you not respecting the dignity of this office.
[Zelenskyy]: I will wear a costume after this war will finish.
[Zelenskyy]: Yes, maybe
[Zelenskyy]: Maybe something like yours, yes?
[Zelenskyy]: Maybe something better, I don't know.
[Zelenskyy]: We will see.
[Zelenskyy]: Maybe something cheaper then, yeah?
[Zelenskyy]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Trump.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Trump.
[SPEAKER_06]: You said yesterday that you have... Are you going to send more arms to Ukraine in peace?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no peace.
[Trump]: Yeah, we're going to have arms to Ukraine.
[Trump]: Yeah, sure.
[Trump]: Hopefully I won't have to send very much because hopefully we're going to have it finished.
[Trump]: We're looking forward to finishing this quickly.
[Trump]: We're not looking forward to sending a lot of arms.
[Trump]: We're looking forward to getting the war finished so we can do other things.
[Trump]: But we very much appreciate the agreement because we needed what they had.
[Trump]: And we're treating, you know, our country is now treated fairly.
[Trump]: Biden didn't do that.
[Trump]: Biden didn't.
[Trump]: He didn't know what the hell he was doing.
[Trump]: This should have never happened.
[Trump]: This should have never started.
[Trump]: But, you know, sure, the answer is yes.
[Trump]: But hopefully we won't have to send much because I'm looking forward to getting it done.
[Trump]: Quickly.
[Trump]: Very quickly.
[SPEAKER_17]: Does that mean you'll provide security guarantees, Mr. President?
[Trump]: I don't want to talk about security yet because I want to get the deal done.
[Trump]: You know, you fall into the same trap like everybody else a million times.
[Trump]: You said over and over.
[Trump]: I want to get the deal done.
[Trump]: Security is so easy.
[Trump]: That's about 2 percent of the problem.
[Trump]: I'm not worried about security.
[Trump]: I'm worried about getting the deal done.
[Trump]: The security is the easy part.
[Trump]: Security is very nice.
[Trump]: Everybody stops shooting.
[Trump]: And now with Europe, put people there.
[Trump]: I know France is going to.
[Trump]: I know the UK is going to.
[Trump]: I know other countries are going to, and they happen to be right next door.
[Trump]: We haven't committed, but we could conceivably.
[Trump]: You know, we have security in a different form.
[Trump]: We'll have workers there.
[Trump]: digging, digging, digging, taking the raw earth so that we can create a lot of great product in this country.
[Trump]: So, in that sense, you have something.
[Trump]: But we haven't determined that yet.
[Trump]: I will say, in speaking to France and in speaking to – and they were here, as you know, last week and just the other day.
[Trump]: They have committed to a lot of security.
[Trump]: I don't think you're going to need much security.
[Trump]: I think once this deal gets done, it's over.
[Trump]: Russia is not going to want to go back, and nobody is going to want to go back.
[Trump]: When this deal ends, I really believe this deal is going to be over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: and McCrone and Keir Starmer at the White House this past week, both of whom praised your courage and conviction to lead the pathway towards peace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of that involved, though, re-engaging Russia in diplomatic relations, something that previous leaders lacked the conviction to do so.
[SPEAKER_02]: What gave you the moral courage and conviction to step forward and lead that?
[Trump]: Well, I love this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who are you with?
[Trump]: Well, that's why I like him.
[Trump]: One American who's a great job.
[Trump]: That's very — I like the question.
[Trump]: I think it's a very good question.
[Trump]: It is — it's a pathway to peace.
[Trump]: It's a pathway to getting something solved.
[Trump]: And I feel that as the head of this country, I have an obligation to do that.
[Trump]: Plus, you know, we're very much involved.
[Trump]: We got involved.
[Trump]: It's too bad we got involved because there should have been no involvement because there should have been no war.
[Trump]: And there shouldn't have been October 7th.
[Trump]: That would have never happened.
[Trump]: As you know, Iran was broke.
[Trump]: They had no money to give to Hezbollah.
[Trump]: They had no money to give to Hamas.
[Trump]: They were stone cold broke.
[Trump]: And then under Biden, they became rich as hell.
[Trump]: They went from no money
[Trump]: to $300 billion in a period of four years.
[Trump]: And they gave a lot of that money away, and you see what happened.
[Trump]: And that's a real mess also that we hope to be able to solve.
[Trump]: But, no, I appreciate your question very much.
[Trump]: I just — I feel I have an obligation to try and do something to stop the death.
[Trump]: I can, if I can answer.
[Trump]: If I can answer, sorry.
[Trump]: Please, please.
[Trump]: And I do like your clothing well.
[Trump]: Yeah, really?
[Trump]: Even I have to, I think he's a great guy, by the way.
[Trump]: But I don't know if you two like each other, but you know what?
[Trump]: I think he's good.
[Trump]: I like this guy.
[Zelenskyy]: I think he's dressed beautifully.
[Zelenskyy]: So I have more serious things than answer on such a question.
[Zelenskyy]: I will answer on more serious questions if I can.
[Zelenskyy]: Yeah, so please, about security guarantees.
[Zelenskyy]: and about the ceasefire.
[Zelenskyy]: We can't just speak about ceasefire and speak and speak.
[Zelenskyy]: It will not work.
[Zelenskyy]: The ceasefire will not never work because I'm like a president.
[Zelenskyy]: I have this experience and not only me.
[Zelenskyy]: Ukraine, before my presidency, from the 2014 Putin broken 25 times.
[Zelenskyy]: 25 times he broken.
[Zelenskyy]: his own signature, 25 times he broke his fire.
[Zelenskyy]: But he never broke to me.
[Zelenskyy]: He never broke to me.
[Zelenskyy]: No, no, you were the president.
[Zelenskyy]: He never broke to me.
[Trump]: You were the president during... He never broke to me.
[Zelenskyy]: In 2016, you've been the president, Mr. President.
[Zelenskyy]: You've been the president, but he had, of course, not with you, but he had, during those periods, he had conversations with our side, and we had Normandy format, you know, the France, Germany, Ukraine, and Russia, and he broken 25 times.
[Zelenskyy]: That's why we will never
[Zelenskyy]: accept just his fire.
[Zelenskyy]: It will not work without security guarantees.
[Zelenskyy]: Security guarantees, maybe the President is right about this document and other, but this document is not enough.
[Zelenskyy]: Strong army is enough because his soldiers afraid, Putin's soldiers afraid of our soldiers when we're strong enough.
[Zelenskyy]: If we are not strong enough, if we are empty, if our storage is empty, we can't defend our land.
[Zelenskyy]: Today, you know,
[Zelenskyy]: He knows that we have, all the world knows that we have meeting.
[Zelenskyy]: Yes?
[Zelenskyy]: Why he's using ballistic?
[Zelenskyy]: Put him today using ballistic.
[Zelenskyy]: On our hospital schools and etc.
[Zelenskyy]: Ballistic.
[Zelenskyy]: So he knows that we are here and that President Trump is really, have good will to stop this war.
[Zelenskyy]: And you hear now the President.
[Zelenskyy]: So why he's using it?
[Zelenskyy]: So he doesn't want to stop?
[Zelenskyy]: He doesn't want.
[Zelenskyy]: But I hope that we will do it, really, we'll do it.
[Zelenskyy]: Security, when we speak about security guarantees, when the Europeans are ready for contingents, they need USA backstop.
[Zelenskyy]: If there will not be United States, we will not have any strong contingents from the Europeans because they don't want to divide allies' connection between the United States and the main and strongest allies and Europeans.
[Zelenskyy]: This is crucial.
[Zelenskyy]: This is important.
[Zelenskyy]: That's what we want to speak about very much.
[Zelenskyy]: This is very important.
[Zelenskyy]: And they are in defense.
[Zelenskyy]: So air defense really, we have big deficit with all the systems and we need to provide this, we need it very much.
[Zelenskyy]: Otherwise Putin will never stop and will go further and further.
[Zelenskyy]: It doesn't work.
[Zelenskyy]: He hates us, you know?
[Zelenskyy]: It's not about me.
[Zelenskyy]: He hates Ukrainians.
[Zelenskyy]: He thinks that we are not a nation.
[Zelenskyy]: He thinks and he shares this source, I think maybe with your team also, I don't know.
[Zelenskyy]: But with all the Europeans in media, official and not, he always said that there is no such country, such nation, such language and such life like Ukrainian.
[Zelenskyy]: No, he really doesn't respect all the Ukrainians and he wants destroy us.
[Zelenskyy]: And you are right, Mr. President.
[Zelenskyy]: That's 2%.
[Zelenskyy]: These documents, maybe other documents, it's a very good start, very good, but it will not enough to stop this person.
[Zelenskyy]: This is the rule of the war.
[Zelenskyy]: This is the rule of the war.
[Zelenskyy]: During all the centuries, all the history, this is the rule of the war.
[Zelenskyy]: Who began those pain.
[Trump]: This is the rule.
[Zelenskyy]: Putin began this war.
[Zelenskyy]: He has to pay all money for innovation.
[Zelenskyy]: He has to pay.
[Zelenskyy]: Of course, some Russian assets what we have in Europe, about 300 billion, we can use them.
[Zelenskyy]: We can use for innovation and buy military support from the United States also.
[Zelenskyy]: We can do it, but it's not enough.
[Zelenskyy]: I asked this question that you didn't like because I wanted to know
[Zelenskyy]: If you want to position yourself in the middle between Russia and Ukraine, or on the Ukraine's belt.
[Trump]: No, I'm in the middle.
[Trump]: I want to solve this thing.
[Trump]: I'm for both.
[Trump]: I want to get it solved.
[Trump]: And it's wonderful to speak badly about somebody else, but I want to get it solved.
[Trump]: If we can solve it, great.
[Trump]: If we can't solve it, they're going to have to find it out, and who knows what's going to happen.
[Trump]: But I want to see it get solved.
[Zelenskyy]: One more question about the US troops in Europe.
[Zelenskyy]: After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, your predecessor sent additional troops to Eastern Europe, including Poland, my country.
[Zelenskyy]: Are you committed to keeping these troops on the Eastern flank of NATO
[Trump]: I'm very committed to Poland.
[Trump]: I think Poland has really stepped up and done a great job for NATO.
[Trump]: As you know, they paid more than they had to.
[Trump]: They are one of the finest groups of people I've ever known.
[Trump]: I'm very committed to Poland.
[Trump]: Poland is in a tough neighborhood.
[Trump]: What about the Baltics?
[Trump]: They got a lot of — it's a tough neighborhood, too, but we're committed.
[Trump]: We're going to be very committed, and we're committed to NATO.
[Trump]: But NATO has to step up, and the Europeans have to step up more than they have.
[Trump]: And I want to see them equalized, because they are in for far less than we're in.
[Trump]: And they should be at least equal.
[Trump]: You understand that?
[Trump]: Why is the United States – we have an ocean in between.
[Trump]: Why is the United States in for so much more money and other things as Europe?
[Trump]: With that being said, and as you said, they've also been obviously very helpful.
[Trump]: But we have put in far more than they have.
[Trump]: And I think they should equalize.
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, about the agreement again today, what changed between the first time that Secretary Besin gave President Zelensky the agreement and today for the signing?
[Trump]: We made a deal.
[Trump]: I'm a business person.
[Trump]: We made a deal.
[Trump]: That's what changed.
[Trump]: I didn't think we were going to make a deal.
[Trump]: And we ended up making the deal, so that changed you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, why don't you envision a trilateral summit with President Zelensky and Putin?
[Trump]: I don't know, but they don't like each other.
[Trump]: I can tell you that.
[Trump]: They do not like each other.
[Trump]: This is not a love match.
[Trump]: And it's unfortunate.
[Trump]: That's why you're in this situation.
[Trump]: The United States should not have allowed this to happen, okay?
[Trump]: The United States, run by a man that didn't know
[Trump]: much.
[Trump]: I'm going to be very nice, run by an incompetent person, very incompetent person, should never have allowed this to happen.
[Trump]: I've stopped wars.
[Trump]: I've stopped many wars.
[Trump]: My people will tell you I stopped wars that nobody ever heard about.
[Trump]: I stopped wars before they ever started.
[Trump]: You can look at some of the – some of – I could give you a lot of nations that would tell you right now they were probably going to war.
[Trump]: I could tell you right now there's a nation thinking about going to war on something that nobody in this room has ever even heard of – two smaller nations, but big, still big.
[Trump]: And I think I've stopped it.
[Trump]: But this should have never happened.
[Zelenskyy]: Sorry, just a second.
[Zelenskyy]: About any negotiations.
[Zelenskyy]: First of all, I want to relate to tell you, and I think that everybody understands that Ukraine, modern Ukrainians, nobody wants to stop this war.
[Zelenskyy]: But in the future, any negotiations, it's understandable that
[Zelenskyy]: two sides of the war, not Russia and the United States, because this is not the war between Russia and the United States.
[Zelenskyy]: This is war of Russia against Ukraine and Ukrainian people.
[Zelenskyy]: So these two sides will be, anyway, will be at the negotiation
[Zelenskyy]: and negotiation table, then of course United States, like the strongest partner of the Ukraine.
[Zelenskyy]: And of course Europe.
[Zelenskyy]: I think Europe is very important.
[Zelenskyy]: I want to speak about it with the President.
[Zelenskyy]: Yes, Europe is very important for us because we really defend Europe for today.
[Zelenskyy]: All Europeans really recognize that we are defending the line.
[Zelenskyy]: and they have real life and our people are dying that's why they helped us and also it's about the nature yes between like the president said you have big nice ocean yes between us but if we will not stay Russia will go further to Baltics and to Poland by the way but first to the Baltics it's understandable for them because they've been
[Zelenskyy]: They've been in the USSR.
[Zelenskyy]: You know, they've been one of the republics of the USSR.
[Zelenskyy]: And Putin was to bring them back to his empire.
[Zelenskyy]: It's a fact.
[Zelenskyy]: And when he will go there, if we will not stay, you will fight.
[Zelenskyy]: You are American soldiers.
[Zelenskyy]: It doesn't matter.
[Zelenskyy]: Do you have ocean or not?
[Zelenskyy]: Your soldiers will fight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, would it be willing to visit Ukraine, maybe Kiev or Odessa, which is going to be a 30-year-old legacy?
[Zelenskyy]: It was my question.
[Trump]: I don't want to talk about Odessa now.
[Trump]: Let's not talk about Odessa.
[Trump]: I want to talk about making a deal, getting peace.
[Trump]: We don't have to talk about Odessa.
[Trump]: But a lot of cities have been destroyed.
[Trump]: A lot of cities that are not recognizable.
[Trump]: There's not a building standing.
[Zelenskyy]: No, no.
[Zelenskyy]: You have to come, Mr. President.
[Zelenskyy]: You have to come and to look.
[Zelenskyy]: No, no, no.
[Zelenskyy]: We have very good cities.
[Zelenskyy]: Yes, a lot of things have been destroyed, but mostly cities are alive, and people work, and children go to school.
[Zelenskyy]: Sometimes it's very difficult.
[Zelenskyy]: Sometimes closer to the front line, children have to go to underground schools or online, but we live.
[Zelenskyy]: Ukraine is fighting, and Ukraine lives.
[Zelenskyy]: This is very important.
[Zelenskyy]: And maybe Putin is sharing this information that he destroyed us.
[Zelenskyy]: No, he lost 700,000 people, 700,000 soldiers.
[Zelenskyy]: He lost everything.
[Zelenskyy]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President, one more.
[SPEAKER_01]: When did you last meet with President Putin?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what did he say a couple of days ago?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what did he tell you that gave you the assurance that he wanted peace?
[Trump]: Well, that's what I do.
[Trump]: My whole life is deal.
[Trump]: I know pretty good.
[Trump]: And I really, I've known him for a long time.
[Trump]: I've dealt with him for a long time.
[Trump]: He had to suffer through the Russia hoax.
[Trump]: You know, Russia, Russia, Russia was a hoax.
[Trump]: It was all Biden.
[Trump]: It was nothing to do with him.
[Trump]: So he had to suffer through that.
[Trump]: And he was able to do that.
[Trump]: I think that he wants to make a deal and he would like to see it end.
[Trump]: That's all I do.
[Trump]: That's what I do.
[Trump]: My whole life, that's what I do is make deals.
[Trump]: I'm in the middle of a mess because this is a real mess.
[Trump]: It's a very dangerous one.
[Trump]: If this doesn't get solved now, it's not going to get solved for a long time.
[Trump]: So I hope we're going to get it solved.
[Trump]: In the back, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prime Minister Stormer cling repeatedly that his government believes in free speech and is not engaged in censorship.
[SPEAKER_00]: But his country is governing the rest people for means and crimes and even more worrisome is pressuring American companies to censor Americans on its behalf.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can he be a reliable, trustworthy partner when he says things that are demonstrably false on such an important basis?
[Trump]: Well, we actually spoke to him about that yesterday, and we thought they took it very, very much too far.
[Trump]: JD was very strong on it.
[Trump]: So was I. So was Marco.
[Trump]: And we've been speaking to him about it.
[Trump]: Marco, would you like to say something about it?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we have concerns, obviously, with the conduct of those, particularly as it impacts Americans.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's real concern that American speech, which is online, could fall into the hands of British or any country's jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so this is a point the Vice President made of Munich, and I think it's a very compelling one that unites us with Europe, but much as anything else, is these shared values and one of them being free speech.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so if Americans are threatened by it, we're going to need to take action in that regard.
[Trump]: It's actually a very important question.
[Vance]: We spoke about this in detail with the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and others at lunch yesterday.
[Vance]: And I know that Secretary of Commerce Lutnik followed up in private meetings last night.
[Vance]: This is really important.
[Vance]: We believe Americans have the right to speak their mind, even if we in this room disagree with them.
[Vance]: They have the right to speak their mind in the public square, which is often online these days.
[Vance]: And we're going to defend that right as it pertains to American companies and American citizens vigorously if we have to.
[Vance]: I do think that under the President's leadership, we're going to find common ground with our friends in the U.K.
[Vance]: on this question, but it remains to be seen.
[Vance]: The principle that will guide us is we believe in free speech in this country and we'll fight for it for American citizens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, on the deal, is there any other oil and gas component to the deal?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it all critical?
[Trump]: A little bit.
[Trump]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_05]: On LNG?
[Trump]: But we're not really looking for that so much.
[Trump]: We have more than anybody in the world, by far.
[Trump]: So no, we're not talking about it too much.
[Trump]: But a little bit.
[Trump]: I think it affects also.
[Trump]: But for the most part, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, sir, is there any agreement from Ukraine to purchase US LNG?
[SPEAKER_12]: I've spoken to him on numerous occasions.
[SPEAKER_12]: How was the latest call?
[SPEAKER_12]: What did you discuss?
[Trump]: Are you serious with that question?
[Trump]: It went well.
[Trump]: I think we're going to have a deal.
[SPEAKER_17]: On the minerals, Mr. President, some of those minerals are in the east of Ukraine, not far from the front lines and in areas that Russia has occupied.
[SPEAKER_17]: Will you direct President Putin to withdraw his forces from those areas if there's U.S.
[SPEAKER_17]: interest?
[Trump]: Well, we'll take a look at it at the time.
[Trump]: We have a lot of area.
[Trump]: It's a very big area we're talking about.
[Trump]: So we'll take a look.
[Trump]: I'll study that and I'll see.
[SPEAKER_17]: And who will protect those minerals if they are U.S.
[SPEAKER_17]: interests?
[SPEAKER_17]: Would that be Ukrainian forces?
[Trump]: Well, we'll protect them.
[Trump]: The agreement will protect them.
[SPEAKER_17]: U.S.
[Trump]: forces?
[Trump]: The agreement.
[Trump]: Yeah, we're signing an agreement.
[SPEAKER_17]: The White Russia tries to invade, or there's Russian aggression in response.
[Trump]: I just told you, I don't think that's going to happen.
[Trump]: And if that were going to happen, I wouldn't make a deal.
[Trump]: If I thought that was going to happen, I wouldn't make a deal.
[Trump]: Some people may wonder why.
[Trump]: You know, you ought to focus on CNN and survival, not asking me these ridiculous questions.
[Trump]: Focus on surviving because CNN's got such low ratings.
[Trump]: I don't think they're going to survive.
[Zelenskyy]: Let's go.
[Zelenskyy]: I already mentioned Poland.
[Zelenskyy]: Poland was under Russian control for decades after the Second World War.
[Zelenskyy]: When I was a kid, I looked at the United States not only as a most powerful country, the richest country in the world.
[Zelenskyy]: The country that has great music, great movies, great muscle
[Zelenskyy]: And now I'm talking with my friends in Poland, and they are worried that you align yourself too much with Putin.
[Zelenskyy]: What's your message for them?
[Trump]: Well, if I didn't align myself with both of them, you'd never have a deal.
[Trump]: He wanted me to say really terrible things about Putin and then say, hi, Vladimir.
[Trump]: How are we doing on the deal?
[Trump]: That doesn't work that way.
[Trump]: I'm not aligned with Putin.
[Trump]: I'm not aligned with anybody.
[Trump]: I'm aligned with the United States of America and for the good of the world.
[Trump]: I'm aligned with the world.
[Trump]: And I want to get this thing over with.
[Trump]: You see the hatred he's got for Putin.
[Trump]: It's very tough for me to make a deal with that kind of hate.
[Trump]: He's got tremendous hatred.
[Trump]: And I understand that, but I can tell you the other side isn't exactly in love with
[Trump]: You know, him either.
[Trump]: So it's not a question of alignment.
[Trump]: I have to, I'm aligned with the world.
[Trump]: I want to get the things that I'm aligned with Europe.
[Trump]: I want to see if we can get this thing done.
[Trump]: You want me to be tough?
[Trump]: I could be tougher than any human being you've ever seen.
[Trump]: I'd be so tough.
[Trump]: But you're never going to get a deal that way.
[Trump]: So that's the way it goes.
[Trump]: One more question.
[Vance]: I will respond to this.
[Vance]: So look, for four years in the United States of America, we had a president who stood up at press conferences and talked tough about Vladimir Putin.
[Vance]: And then Putin invaded Ukraine and destroyed a significant chunk of the country.
[Vance]: The path to peace.
[Vance]: And the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy.
[Vance]: We tried the pathway of Joe Biden of thumping our chest and pretending that the President of the United States' words mattered more than the President of the United States' actions.
[Vance]: What makes America a good country is America engaging in diplomacy.
[Vance]: That's what President Trump is doing.
[Zelenskyy]: sure yeah yeah okay so he occupied it our parts big parts of Ukraine part of East and Crimea so he occupied it on 2014 so
[Zelenskyy]: During a lot of years, I'm not speaking about just Biden, but those time was Obama, then President Obama, then President Trump, then President Biden, now President Trump, and God bless, now President Trump will stop him.
[Zelenskyy]: But during 2014, nobody stopped him.
[Zelenskyy]: He just occupied and took.
[Zelenskyy]: He killed people.
[Zelenskyy]: You know what the contact was?
[Zelenskyy]: 2014, 2014.
[Zelenskyy]: I was not here.
[Zelenskyy]: That's exactly right.
[Zelenskyy]: Yes, but during 2014 till 2022, the situation is the same that people have been dying on the contact line.
[Zelenskyy]: Nobody stopped him.
[Zelenskyy]: You know that we had conversations with him.
[Zelenskyy]: A lot of conversation, my bilateral conversation.
[Zelenskyy]: And we signed with him, me, like a new president in 2019.
[Zelenskyy]: I signed with him the deal.
[Zelenskyy]: I signed with him Macron and Merkel, we signed ceasefire.
[Zelenskyy]: Ceasefire, all of them told me that he will never go.
[Zelenskyy]: We signed with him gas contract, gas contract.
[Zelenskyy]: Yes, but after that, he broken this fire.
[Zelenskyy]: He killed our people and he didn't exchange prisoners.
[Zelenskyy]: We signed the exchange of prisoners, but he didn't do it.
[Zelenskyy]: What kind of diplomacy, GD, you are speaking about?
[Vance]: What do you mean?
[Vance]: I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country.
[Vance]: Yes, but if you are not... Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.
[Vance]: Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you have manpower problems.
[Vance]: You should be thanking the President for trying to bring it into this conflict.
[Vance]: Have you ever been to Ukraine that you say what problems we have?
[Vance]: I have actually watched and seen the stories and I know what happens is you bring people, you bring them on a propaganda tour Mr. President, do you disagree that you've had problems bringing people into your military?
[Vance]: And do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?
[Zelenskyy]: A lot of questions.
[Zelenskyy]: Let's start from the beginning.
[Zelenskyy]: Sure.
[Zelenskyy]: First of all, during the war, everybody has problems.
[Zelenskyy]: Even you, but you have nice ocean and don't feel now.
[Zelenskyy]: But you will feel it in the future.
[Zelenskyy]: God bless.
[Zelenskyy]: You don't know that.
[Zelenskyy]: God bless.
[Zelenskyy]: God bless.
[Zelenskyy]: You will not have a war.
[Trump]: Don't tell us what we're going to feel.
[Trump]: We're trying to solve a problem.
[Trump]: Don't tell us what we're going to feel.
[Trump]: I'm not telling you.
[Trump]: Because you're in no position to dictate that.
[Trump]: That's exactly what I'm saying.
[Trump]: You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel.
[Trump]: We're going to feel very good and very strong.
[Trump]: You're right now not in a very good position.
[Trump]: You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position.
[Zelenskyy]: You're not in a good position.
[Trump]: You don't have the cards right now.
[Trump]: With us you start having cars, but right now you don't have your plane cars.
[Trump]: You're gambling with the lives of millions of people.
[Trump]: You're gambling with World War III.
[Trump]: You're gambling with World War III.
[Trump]: And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country, that's back to you.
[Trump]: Far more than a lot of people said they should have.
[Trump]: Have you said thank you once?
[Vance]: No, in this entire meeting you said thank you.
[Vance]: You went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October, all for some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the President who's trying to save your country.
[Zelenskyy]: Please, you think that if you will speak very loudly about the war, you can speak loudly.
[Trump]: He's not speaking loudly.
[Trump]: He's not speaking loudly.
[Trump]: Your country is in big trouble.
[Trump]: Can I have some?
[Trump]: No, no.
[Trump]: You've done a lot of talking.
[Trump]: Your country is in big trouble.
[Trump]: I know.
[Zelenskyy]: You're not winning.
[Zelenskyy]: I know.
[Trump]: You're not winning this.
[Trump]: You have a damn good chance of coming out okay because of us.
[Zelenskyy]: We are staying in our country staying strong from the very beginning of the war.
[Zelenskyy]: We've been alone and we are thankful.
[Zelenskyy]: I said thanks in this cabinet.
[Trump]: We gave you the stupid president.
[Trump]: 350 billion dollars, we gave you military equipment, and you met a brave but they had to use our military equipment.
[Trump]: If you didn't have our military equipment, if you didn't have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks.
[Zelenskyy]: In three days, I heard it from Putin, in three days, this is something to do in two weeks, of course, yes.
[Trump]: It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this.
[Vance]: I tell you, just say thank you, accept that there are disagreements, and let's go litigate those disagreements rather than trying to fight it out in the American media when you're wrong.
[Vance]: We know that you're wrong.
[Trump]: But you see, I think it's good for the American people to see what's going on.
[Vance]: I understand, sir.
[Vance]: I understand.
[Trump]: I think it's very important.
[Trump]: That's why I kept this going so long.
[Trump]: You have to be thankful.
[Trump]: You don't have the cards.
[Trump]: You're buried there.
[Trump]: You have people that died.
[Trump]: You're running low on soldiers.
[Trump]: Listen, you're running low on soldiers.
[Trump]: It would be a damn good thing.
[Trump]: Then you tell us, I don't want to cease fire.
[Trump]: I don't want to cease fire.
[Trump]: I want to go and I want to decide.
[Trump]: Look,
[Trump]: If you could get a ceasefire right now, I tell you, you take it so the bullets stop flying and your men stop getting killed.
[Zelenskyy]: Of course, we want to stop the war.
[Zelenskyy]: But you're saying you don't want a ceasefire?
[Zelenskyy]: But I said to you, we're his guarantees.
[Trump]: Because you'll get a ceasefire faster than any agreement.
[Trump]: Ask our people about ceasefire, what they think.
[Trump]: It doesn't matter for you what they think.
[Trump]: That wasn't with me.
[Trump]: That was with a guy named Biden, who was not a smart person.
[Trump]: That was with Obama.
[Trump]: Excuse me.
[Trump]: That was with Obama, who gave you sheets, and I gave you javelins.
[Trump]: I gave you the javelins to take out all those tanks.
[Trump]: Obama gave you sheets.
[Trump]: In fact, the statement is Obama gave sheets and Trump gave javelins.
[Trump]: You got to be more thankful.
[Trump]: Because let me tell you, you don't have the cards.
[Trump]: With us, you have the cards.
[Trump]: But without us, you don't have any cards.
[Trump]: What are you saying?
[Vance]: She's asking what if Russia breaks the ceasefire?
[Trump]: What if anything?
[Trump]: What if the bomb drops on your head right now?
[Trump]: Okay?
[Trump]: What if they broke it?
[Trump]: I don't know.
[Trump]: They broke it with Biden because Biden, they didn't respect him.
[Trump]: They didn't respect Obama.
[Trump]: They respect me.
[Trump]: Let me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me.
[Trump]: He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him in Russia.
[Trump]: Russia, Russia, Russia.
[Trump]: You ever hear of that deal?
[Trump]: That was a phony, that was a phony Hunter Biden, Joe Biden scam.
[Trump]: Hillary Clinton, shifty Adam Schiff.
[Trump]: It was a Democrat scam.
[Trump]: And he had to go through that.
[Trump]: And he did go through it.
[Trump]: We didn't end up in a war.
[Trump]: And he went through it.
[Trump]: He was accused of all that stuff.
[Trump]: He had nothing to do with it.
[Trump]: It came out of Hunter Biden's bathroom.
[Trump]: It came out of Hunter Biden's bedroom.
[Trump]: It was disgusting.
[Trump]: And then they said, oh, oh, the laptop from hell was made by Russia, the 51 agents.
[Trump]: The whole thing was a scam.
[Trump]: And he had to put up with that.
[Trump]: He was being accused of all that stuff.
[Trump]: All I can say is this, he might have broken deals with Obama and Bush, and he might have broken them with Biden.
[Trump]: He did.
[Trump]: Maybe.
[Trump]: Maybe he didn't.
[Trump]: I don't know what happened.
[Trump]: But he didn't break them with me.
[Trump]: He wants to make a deal.
[Trump]: I don't know if he can make a deal.
[Trump]: The problem is, I've empowered you to be a tough guy.
[Trump]: And I don't think you'd be a tough guy without the United States.
[Trump]: And your people are very brave.
[Trump]: But you're either going to make a deal or we're out.
[Trump]: And if we're out, you'll fight it out.
[Trump]: I don't think it's going to be pretty, but you'll fight it out.
[Trump]: But you don't have the cards.
[Trump]: But once we sign that deal, you're in a much better position.
[Trump]: But you're not acting at all thankful.
[Trump]: And that's not a nice thing.
[Trump]: I'll be honest.
[Trump]: That's not a nice thing.
[Trump]: All right.
[Trump]: I think we've seen enough.
[Trump]: What do you think?
[Trump]: This is going to be great television.
[Trump]: I will say that.
[Trump]: We'll see what we can do about putting it.
[Trump]: Thanks, sir.
