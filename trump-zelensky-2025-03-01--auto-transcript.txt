00:03
well thank you very much it's an honor to have President zalinski of Ukraine and we've been working very hard very close so we've actually known each other for a long time we've been uh dealing with each other for a long time and very well uh we had little negotiation spat

00:20
but that worked out great I think for for both countries I think for the world actually Beyond both countries and we have something that is a very fair deal and we look forward to getting in and digging digging digging and working and getting some of the rare earth but it

00:38
means we're going to be inside and it's a it's a big commitment from the United States and we appreciate working with you very much and uh we will continue to do that we have had some very good discussions with Russia I spoke with President Putin and we're going to try

00:55
and bring this to a close it's something that you want and that he wants we have to negotiate a deal but we've started the confines of a deal and I think something can happen uh the big thing is the uh number of soldiers mostly at this point but soldiers being killed you're losing thousands of

01:14
soldiers on both sides we're losing a lot of soldiers and we want to see it stop and we want to see the money get put to different kinds of use like rebuilding the rebuilding and we're going to be working very hard but we've had a lot of very good conversations will'll say until we came along the

01:32
Biden Administration didn't speak to Russia whatsoever they didn't speak to anybody they just allowed this to continue and uh I will say that uh I'll say in front of you you've heard me say it a thousand times if I were president this war would have never happened we

01:48
would have had a deal negotiated for you without having to go through what you've gone through but you uh your soldiers have been unbelievably Brave we've given them great equipment but they somebody has to use the equipment they've been unbelievably Brave and we give them

02:04
great credit this was supposed to be over very quickly and uh here we are three years later so I give tremendous credit to your generals and your soldiers and yourself in the sense that uh it's been very hard fighting very tough fighting they have great Fighters

02:23
and uh you have to be very proud of them from that standpoint but now we want to get it over with it's enough right we want to get it over with so uh it's an honor to have you here thank you very much for coming we're going to sign uh the agreement at the conference in the

02:39
East room in a little while right after lunch and we'll be having lunch together we're also discussing some other things and we appreciate everybody being here it's a somewhat of an exciting moment but the really exciting moment is when we get a when they stop the shooting or

02:56
we end up with a deal and I think we're fairly close to getting that and uh an honor to have you and please you like to say something yeah thank you so much Mr President thank you for invitation and uh really I hope that this um document first document will be first step to

03:15
real security guarantees for Ukraine our people our children I really count on it and of course we count that America will not stop support really for us is very important to support and to continue it I want to discuss it with details further during our conversation and of

03:34
course the infrastructure or security guarantees because for today I understand what Europe is ready to do and of course I want to discuss with you what United States will be ready to do and uh I really count on your strong position to stop Putin and uh and you said that enough with the War I think

03:53
that is very important been to say these words to Putin at the very beginning at the very beginning of War because he is a kid and terrorist but I hope that together we can stop him but for us is very important to you know to save our country our values our freedom the democracy and of course uh no

04:14
compromises with the killer about our territories but it will be later and of course I what I wanted you know we spoke about it by phone with you about the drones production we have very good drones production I think the best one in the world for today because of the

04:29
war yes and uh of course we need very much uh the air defense you have the best air defense in the world and really you help us under attacks of Russians and I want to speak how we can exchange the licenses we're open to share the licenses of all our drones with you of

04:48
course with the United States and we need licenses for quick production of air defense even after the war we need our nation to be calm that we are secured so that's why we need this shield and of course about this uh I want to speak about the contingence I think that France and UK already spoke

05:08
to you and we know that Europe is ready but without United States they will not be ready to be as strong as we need and uh the last point last not least uh about exchange about our people and children and you know that this crazy Russian that they stolen 20,000 of

05:28
children Ukrainian children they changed their names they changed their you know their families relatives and uh now they in Russia we want to bring them back and really it's a big big dream task and goal for me and and the our Warriors we by the way Mr we brought we exchanged we

05:49
yes released more than 4,000 Warriors from Russian prison but there are thousands more in the prison I wanted to share with you some some images how how just just can can I can I now yeah pleas pleas some one minute one minute I just you to understand what in what

06:12
circumstances in what situation they are and what the attitude of Russia to our prisoners that guys just you before before and after and you see before and after just you to understand now thousands of such guys ladies and men they and that's so they don't eat they beat them and they you

06:34
know do a lot of a lot of you know bad things so out out of even during the war There Are Rules everybody knows There are rules during the war these guys they don't have any rules you see that 50 60 kilg and and a lot of such things and I didn't want to show you what what the

06:56
changes with images of children because I will share just share with you I mean it's looking tragic y that's tough stuff yeah wondered very much to to give you and you you see this is Pastor by the way they stolen pastors because it's not Russian Church stolen pastors and mov

07:18
pastors to the prison we at the end of last year we we brought three pastors and we we could exchange them but this is Pastor you see like yeah that's St yeah so I'm inan this I wanted to show you and um this so thank you very much we want to get that ended right yeah yeah of course of course we

07:40
will I think we will I think we will and uh we have to of course do you have any questions please thank you Mr President um with the how much money is the US going to put into the fund that that is being created today and how does this provide long-term security for Ukraine well we

07:59
don't know exactly how much because we're going to be putting some money in a fund uh that we're going to get from the raw Earth that we're going to be taking and sharing in terms of Revenue so it's going to be a lot of money will be made from the sale and from the use

08:13
of raw Earth and as you know our country doesn't have much raw Earth we have a lot of oil and gas but we don't have a lot of the raw Earth and what we do have is protected by the environmentalists but that could be unprotected but still it's not very much uh they have F among

08:32
the best in the world in terms of so we're going to be using that taking it using it for all of the things we do including Ai and including weapons and the military and it's uh really going to very much satisfy our needs so something that just worked out uh really well we

08:50
have a lot of oil and we have a lot of gas we have a lot but we don't have raw Earth so uh this uh this has just about every component of the raw Earth that we need for computers for all of the things we do this puts us in great shape and long-term security for ukra this Prov I

09:06
think they're going to have great long I think once we make the agreement that's going to be 95% of it it's they're not going to go back to fighting uh I've spoken with President Putin and uh I think I mean I feel very strong I've known him for a long time and I feel

09:21
very strongly that uh they're very serious about it and we'll make a deal and when the deal is made I don't think we talk about security everyone's talking about the other day all they talked about was security I said let me make the deal first I have to make the

09:35
deal first I don't worry about security right now I got have to we have to have a deal because right now last week 2,000 soldiers died on both sides 2,000 and they're losing a th000 2,000 3,000 a week so as we sit here and we talk people are getting shot and dying on the

09:53
battlefield and you know they're not American soldiers but they're Russian soldiers and they're Ukrainian soldiers and we want to be able to stop it and we want to be able also to spend money on other things we don't want to this is a tremendous amount of money and what the

10:08
Biden Administration did was terrible they were giving money but he had no security on the money Europe as you know gave much less money but they had security it was in the form of a loan they get their money back and we didn't and now at least we're protected because the American taxpayer has to be

10:25
protected too but uh this is an incredible agreement for Ukraine because we have a big investment in their country now and and what what they have very few people have and we're able to uh really go forward with very very high-tech things and many other things including Weaponry Weaponry that we're

10:47
going to use in many locations but that we need for our country this allows this allows us to do this yes go ahead if if I can just yes in the document there is one of the very important points uh if we speak about business and investment we never had LG terminals in

11:12
Ukraine this document will open I mean the next documents but anyway the here we see in the framework we we see we see a really good will for this L terminals for us is very important and I think for security of European continent we have the biggest storage gas storage we have

11:30
the biggest in Europe yes it's yeah and we can use it you for LNG use it for for LNG and we will do it and really we we can help Europe because Europe really helped president Trump said that they made uh less support but they have our friends and they our very supportive uh

11:50
Partners they really gave a lot Mr bread really they did they gave a lot but they gave much less no no okay uh Mr President Trump you have repeatedly called the deal with Ukraine has as a historical one and as a president of the United States you make historical decision in other issues

12:24
which affect America and other world so uh what play in the world history do you want to take and do you associate your yourself with any famous historical figures yeah I'd say George Washington Abraham Lincoln I would say I'm far superior to George Washington and

12:48
Abraham Lincoln now you know I'm only kidding right because when I say that the fake news is going to go wild they're G to say he considers himself to be better than Washington but you never know you never know uh I don't compare myself to anybody I just have I'm here to do a job we've had

13:04
a great 35 days or whatever it might be a month a little more than a month uh We've accomplished tremendous amounts not only this this would be a very great achievement if we could get this the war stopped and get them back to normalization I think that's going to

13:21
happen we've had very good talks on both sides as you know but uh I think we've done a very good job just generally if you look at all of the things we've done done in 30 days they're saying there's never been a opening for a president the first month uh there's never been a

13:36
first month like uh like we've had and this is one of the very important things this to me is one of the most important things because we have tremendous death taking place as we speak and I don't want to have that you know think of the parents think of the whether they're in

13:52
Russia or Ukraine think of the parents of all these people being killed needlessly they came to all Earth should have never started this would if I were president this would have never started will you continue sending military aid to Ukraine after you uh the US signs this agreement with Ukraine

14:17
question to president zensky do you feel like the US is on your side that the president the president Trump is on your side at this uh at this moment what do you think he wants to know do you think that sort of a stupid question I guess I guess we wouldn't be here if I

14:39
was I think that I think that the United States on our side from the very beginning of occupation and uh I think that President Trump on our side and and of course and not I'm sure that United States President will not stop support this is crucial for us it's important for us yes

14:60
and Putin president speaks about the people and the soldiers which are dying but they came to our territory they came to our land they began this war and they have to stop and uh I think all this is the question with really the most important question can president Trump I

15:17
hope yes with some other allies to stop Putin withdraw this enemies our enem withdraw these troops from our land and I think that you asked about the history about the I think that if president or when he will stop Putin if president Trump will bring peace to our country I

15:38
think he will be on this wall and time we've had very very good uh talks president zinski just said that there' be no compromises with um Vlad Putin um I just wanted to ask both of you firstly um are there compromises that you think that president zalinski is going to have to make and president

16:03
zalinski is there anything that you might you think you may be able to offer or bring to the table for example elections thank you I think you're going to have to always make compromises you can't do any deals without compromises so certainly he's going to have to make

16:16
some compromises but hopefully they won't be as big as some people think you're going to have to make that's all it's all we can do I'm here as a as an arbitrator as a mediator to a certain extent between two parties that have uh been very hostile to put it mildly they've been very hostile has been a

16:33
vicious War this been a vicious War you know it's a very level Battlefield and uh those bullets go out and as I've said many times we're talking about it with Pete uh many times the only thing stopping those bullets is a human body and in the case we're talking about generally young human bodies are

16:51
stopping a lot of bullets it's dead level that's what why it's great Farmland it's great land it's great Farmland but there's very little protection against the bullets that are being and other things that are being shot so all I can do is see if I can get everybody at the table and get an

17:09
agreement and I think we're going to end up with an agreement otherwise I wouldn't probably be even here today Mr President I've got two questions for you you think ultimately your legacy will be The Peacemaker and not the president that led this country into another war and ended Foreign Wars

17:29
and I've got a a question I hope it will I mean I hope I'm going to be uh remembered as a peacemaker uh this is this would be a great thing if we could do this I'm doing this to save lives more than anything else second is to save a lot of money but I consider that to be far less

17:45
important uh so I hope I'm going to thank you Brian for that question it was a nice question uh I hope I'll be known and recognized as a peacemaker this this would be a great thing to solve this is a very dangerous situation you know this could lead to a third world war this is

18:01
this was headed in the wrong direction if this election were lost and we didn't win this election and by way we won it by a lot that was a mandate we won every swing state we won the popular vote by millions and millions of votes we wanton everything uh the districts you look at

18:18
the areas of of red take a look at a map this was a big mandate and uh this is one of the things I said we're going to get this thing settled if we didn't win I think this would have this could have very well ended up in a third world war and that would not that would not have

18:35
been a good situation what was your second question my second question for president zalinski do you ever why don't you wear a suit you're the highest why don't you wear a suit you're the highest level in this country's office and you refused to wear a suit just want to see

18:49
if you you own a suit yeah yeah problems I I a lot of Americans have problems with you not respecting the digity of this office uh I will wear a costume off after this war will finish okay yes maybe one maybe something like yours yes maybe some something better I don't I

19:08
don't know we will see maybe something cheaper than yeah thank you thank you thank you president Trump you said yesterday are you going to send more arms to Ukraine in case there's no peace yeah we're going to have arms to Ukraine yeah sure hopefully I won't have to send

19:27
very much because hopefully we're going to have have it finished we're looking forward to finishing this quickly uh we're not looking forward to sending a lot of arms we're looking forward to getting the war finished so we can uh do other things but uh we very much appreciate the agreement because we

19:44
needed what they had and we're treating you know our country is now treated fairly Biden didn't do that Biden didn't he didn't know what the hell he was doing this should have never happened they should have never started but uh you know sure the answer is yes but hopefully we won't have to send much

20:00
because I'm looking forward to get it done getting it done quickly very quickly does that provide security guarantees Mr President uh I don't want to talk about security yet because I want to get the deal done you know you fall into the same trap like everybody

20:15
else a million times you say it over and over I want to get the deal done security is so easy that's about 2% of the problem uh I'm not worried about security I'm worried about getting the deal done uh the security is the easy part security is very nice everybody

20:30
stopped shooting and now will Europe put people there I know France is going to I know the UK is going to I know other countries are going to and they happen to be right next door we haven't committed but we could conceivably you know we have Security in a different

20:44
form we have workers there uh digging digging digging taking the raw Earth so that we can create a lot of great product in this country uh so in that sense you have something but we haven't determined that yet I will say uh in speaking to France and in speaking to

21:02
and they were here as you know last week and just the other day uh they have committed to a lot of security I don't think you're going to need much security I think once this deal gets done it's over Russia is not going to want to go back and nobody's going to want to go

21:17
back when this when this deal ends I really believe this deal is is going to be over uh question yeah please go ahead go ahead Mr President thank you uh you had Ming here ster at the White House this past week both of whom praised your courage and conviction to lead the

21:33
pathway towards peace yes part of that involved though re-engaging Russia in diplomatic relations something that previous leaders lacked the conviction to do so what gave you the moral courage and conviction to step forward and Lead that well I love this guy who are you

21:48
with one American News sir well that's that why I like him one American News is a great job that's very I like the question I think it's a very good question it is it's a pathway to peace it's a pathway to getting something solved and I feel that as the head of this country I have an obligation to do

22:05
that plus you know we're very much involved we got involved uh it's too bad we got involved because there should have been no involvement because there should have been no war and there shouldn't have been October 7th that would have never happened as you know Iran was broke they had no money to give

22:22
to Hezbollah they had no money to give to Hamas they were Stone Cold broke and then under Biden they became rich as hell they went from no money to $300 billion in a period of 4 years and they gave a lot of that money away and you see what happened and that's a real mess

22:41
also that we hope to be able to solve but uh no I I appreciate your question very much I just I feel I have an obligation to try and uh do something to stop the death I can if I can answer yes if I can answer sorry please please and I do like your clothing brother yeah really even

23:01
though I have to I think he's a great guy by the way but I I don't know if you two like each other but you know what I think I like this guy I don't I think he's dressed beautiful so I have more I have more serious things than answer on such question I will answer on more

23:17
serious question if I can yeah so please uh about security guarantees and about just CIS fire we can't just speak about CIS fire and speak and speak it will not work Justice fire will not never work because I'm like a president I have I have this experience and not only me Ukraine

23:37
before before my presidency from the 2014 Putin broken 25 times 25 times he broken his own signature 25 times he broken C fire it he never broke to me never no no you were the president you were the president never BR him in 2016 you been the president Mr Mr President

24:00
you've been the president but he for he had of course not with you but he had during those period he had conversations with our side and we had Normandy for format you know the France Germany Ukraine and Russia and he broken 25 times that's why we will never accept just C fire it will not

24:20
work without security guarantees security guarantees maybe president is right about this document and other but this document is not enough strong Army is enough because his soldiers afraid Putin soldiers afraid of our soldiers when we're strong enough if we are not

24:36
strong enough if we are empty if our storage is empty we can't defend our our land today you know he knows that we have me all the world knows that we have meeting yes why he's using ballistic Putin today using ballistic on our Hospital schools and Etc ballistic so he knows that we are here and that

24:57
President Trump is really have good will to stop to stop this war and I and you hear now the president so why he's using so he doesn't want to stop he doesn't want but I hope that we will do it really we'll do it security when we speak about security guarantees when the Europeans are ready for

25:16
contingence they need USA back stop if the world will not be United States we will not never have any conents strong contigent from the Europeans because they don't want to divide all Lance connection between the United States and the main and strongest Sal and Europeans

25:35
and this is crucial this is important that what we want to speak about very much this is very important and they are defense so air defense really we have big deficit with all these systems and we need to provide this we we need it very much otherwise Putin will never

25:54
stop and will go further and further he doesn't want he he hate us you know it's not about me he hate ukrainians he thinks that we are not a nation he thinks and he shared the swords I think maybe with your team also I don't know but with all the Europeans in media

26:11
officially and not he always said that we there is no such country such Nation such language and such life like Ukrainian no he really doesn't respect all the ukrainians and he wants destroy us the we we you are right Mr President that's 2% this document maybe other

26:33
documents it's a very good Star very good but it will not enough to stop this person should Mr R this is Rule of the war this is the rule of the war during all the centuries all the history this is the rule of the war who began those pay do you AG this is the rule Putin began

27:01
this war he has to pay all money for renovation he has to pay of course some Russian assets what we have in Europe about 300 billions we can use them we can use for renovation and buy military support from the United States also we can do it but it's not enough it's not the

27:26
trilateral wait one second I want I ask this question that you didn't like because I wanted to know if you want to position yourself in the middle between Russia and Ukraine or on the Ukraine side no I'm in the middle I want to solve this thing I'm for I'm for both I want to get it solved and uh it's

27:45
wonderful to speak badly about somebody else but uh I want to get it solved if we can solve it great if we can't solve it they're going to have to fight it out and who knows what's going to happen but I want to see it get solved may I follow up one more question about US troops in

28:02
Europe after Russian invasion of Ukraine uh your predecessor sent additional troops to Eastern Europe including Poland my country yeah are you committed to keeping this troops on the Eastern flank of NATO uh in the future I'm very committed to Poland I think Poland has really

28:25
stepped up and done a great job for NATO they as you know they pay more than they had to they are one of the finest groups of people I've ever known uh I'm very committed to Poland what about baltics Poland's in a tough neighborhood you know what about Baltic the baltics uh

28:41
the baltics uh they got a lot of it's a tough neighborhood too but we're committed we're going to be very committed and we're committed to Nato but NATO has to step up and the Europeans have to step up more than they have and I want to see them equalized because they are in for far less than

28:58
we're in and they should be at least equal you understand that why is the United States we have an ocean in between why is the United States in for so much more money and other things as Europe with that being said and as you said they've also been obviously very

29:15
helpful but we have put in far more than they have and I think they should equalize Mr President about the agreement again today what changed between the first time that secretary Bess gave president zalinsky the agreement and today for the signing we made a deal so what was signing Factor I'm I'm a

29:36
business person we made a deal that's what changed I didn't think we were going to make a deal and uh we ended up making the deal so that change Mr President what and how do you envision a trilateral summit with president zinsky and Putin I don't know well they don't

29:51
like each other I can tell you that they do not like each other this is not a love match and it's unfortunate that's why you're in this situation the United States should not have allowed this to happen Okay the United States run by a man that didn't know much I'm going to be very nice run by an

30:14
incompetent person very incompetent person should never have allowed this to happen I've stopped Wars I've stopped many wars my people will tell you I stopped Wars that nobody ever heard about I stopped Wars before they ever started you can look at some of uh some of I could give you a lot of Nations

30:32
that would tell you right now they were probably going to war I could tell you right now there's a nation thinking about going to war on something that nobody in this room has ever even heard about two smaller Nations but big still big and I I think I've stopped it but

30:48
this should have never happened Mr about uh sorry just a second uh about the any negotiations the first of all I want want really to tell you and I think that everybody understand that Ukraine more than ukrainians nobody want to stop this war but at the future any negotiations

31:09
it's understandable that two uh sides of the war not Russia and the United States because this is not the war between Russia and the United States This Is War of Russia against Ukraine and Ukrainian people so these two sides will be at the any anyway will be at the negotiation

31:29
and negotiation table then of course United States like the strongest partner of the Ukraine and of course Europe I think Europe is very important I want to speak about it with the president yes Europe is very important for us because we really defend Europe for today all

31:47
Europeans are really recognized that we are defend in line and they have real life and our people are dying that's why they helped us and also it's about the N yes between like the president said you have big nice ocean yes between us but if we will not stay Russia will go

32:09
further to baltics and to Poland by the way but first to the baltics it's understandable for them because they've been they've been in the USSR you know they they've been one of the republics of the USSR and Putin wants to bring them back to his Empire it's a fact and

32:27
when he will go there if we will not stay you will fight you're American soldiers it doesn't matter do you have otion or not your soldiers will fight Mr President would you be willing to visit Ukraine maybe K or Odessa which is known to be a the with black SE it was my

32:44
question yeah I'm sorry I don't want to talk about Odessa now let's not talk about Odessa I want to talk about making a deal getting peace we don't have to talk about Odessa but a lot of cities have been destroyed a lot of cities that are not recognizable there's not a

33:01
building standing and a lot of a lot of things Mr you have to come and to look no no no we have very good cities yes a lot of things been destroyed but mostly cities alive and people work and children go to school sometimes it's very difficult sometimes closer to Front

33:20
Line children have to go to underground schools or online but we live Ukraine is fighting and Ukraine lives this is very important and maybe it's Putin is sharing this information that he destroyed us know he lost 700,000 people 700,000 soldiers he lost ever SE yes Mr President one

33:46
more when did you last speak with President Putin and what did he say that couple of days ago and what did he tell you that gave you the assurance that he wanted peace well that's what I do my whole life is deals I know pretty good uh and I really I've uh I've known him

34:02
for a long time I've dealt with him for a long time he had a suffer through the uh Russia hoax you know Russia Russia Russia was a hoax it was all Biden it was nothing to do with him so he had to suffer through that and he he was able to do that uh I think that uh he wants

34:18
to make a deal and he like to see it end it's all I do that's what I do my whole life that's what I do is make deals and I'm in the middle of a mess because this is a real mess it's a very dangerous one if this doesn't get solved now it's not going to get solved for a long time so I

34:36
hope we're going to I hope we're going to get it Sol in the back please thank you Mr President uh prime minister St Clint repeatedly that his government believes in free speech and was not engaged in censorship uh but his country's government arrest people for memes and thought crimes and even more

34:51
worrisome is pressuring uh American companies to to to censor Americans on his behalf um how can he a reliable trustworthy partner when he says things that are demonstrably false on such an important well we actually spoke to him about that yesterday and we thought they

35:07
took it very very much too far JD was very strong on it so was I so was Marco and we've been speaking to him about it Marco would you like to say something about yeah we we we have concerns obviously with the conduct of there particularly as it impacts Americans and there's real concern that American

35:24
speech which is online could fall into the hands of British or any country's jurisdiction and so this is a point the vice president made at Munich and and I think it's a very compelling one that what unites us with Europe as much as anything else is these shared values and

35:37
one of them being free speech and so if Americans are threatened by it we're going to need to take action in that regard it's actually a very important question we we spoke about this in detail with the Prime Minister and the foreign secretary and others at at lunch

35:53
yesterday and I know that Secretary of Commerce lutnick followed up in private meeting last night this is really important we believe Americans have the right to speak their mind even if we in this room disagree with them they have the right to speak their mind in the

36:07
Public Square which is often online these days and we're going to defend that right as it pertains to American companies and American citizens vigorously if we have to I do think that under the president's leadership we're going to find common ground with our friends in the UK on this question but

36:21
it remains to be seen the principle that will guide us is we believe in free speech in this country and we'll fight forward for American citizens Mr the deal is there any other oil and gas component to the deal is it all CRI a little bit we'll see on L but we're not

36:37
really looking for that so much we got a lot we have more than anybody in the world by far so no we're not talking about it too much but a little bit I think it it it affects also but uh for the most part no and Sir is there any uh agreement from Ukraine to purchase uh us

36:53
LNG as part of the deal or is that on the table at all no we don't need this I just wanted to ask you about you just mentioned that you'd spoken to Vladimir Putin a couple of days ago just to be clear that's a new call not the one that you I've spoken to him on numerous

37:09
occasions okay and how was the latest call what did you discuss how you are you serious with that question I am i' love to know it went well I think I think we're going to have a deal on the mineral Ste Mr President some of those minerals are in the east of Ukraine not far from the

37:25
front lines and in areas that Russia has OCC will you direct President Putin to to withdraw his forces from those areas if you're there's us interest well we'll take a look at at the time we have a lot of area uh it's a very big area we're talking about so we'll take a look I'll

37:40
study that and I'll see and who would protect those minerals if if they are us interest would that be Ukrainian be protected the agreement will protect them the agreement yeah we're signing an agreement but what if Russia tries to invade or or there's Russian aggression

37:53
and there spots I just told you I don't think that's going to happen and if that were going to happen I wouldn't make a deal if I thought that was going to happen I wouldn't make a deal some people may wonder why you know they ought to focus on CNN on Survival not asking me these ridiculous

38:07
questions focus on Surviving because CNN's got such low ratings I don't think they're going to survive already I already mentioned Poland uh Poland was under Russian control for decades after the second world war when I was a kid I looked at the United United States not only as a

38:30
most powerful country richest country in the world the country that has great music great movies great muscle cars but also as a Force for good do you and now I'm talking with my friends in Poland and they they are worried that you align yourself too much with Putin what's your message for

38:52
them well if I didn't align myself with both of them you'd never have a deal you want me to say uh really terrible things about Putin and then say hi Vladimir how are we doing on the deal that doesn't work that way I'm not aligned with Putin I'm not aligned with anybody I'm aligned with the United

39:10
States of America and for the good of the world I'm aligned with the world and I want to get this thing over with you see the hatred he's got for Putin it's very tough for me to make a deal with that kind of hat he's got tremendous hatred and I understand that but I can

39:25
tell you the other side isn't exactly in love with you know him either uh so it's not a question of alignment I have to I'm aligned with the world I want to get the things set i'm aligned with Europe I want to see if we can get this thing done you want me to be tough I

39:43
could be tougher than any human being you've ever seen I'd be so tough but you're never going to get a deal that way so that's the way it goes all right one more questiony I would to respond to this so look for four years in the United States of America we a president who stood up

39:59
at press conferences and talked tough about Vladimir Putin and then Putin invaded Ukraine and destroyed a significant chunk of the country the path to peace and the path to Prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy we tried the pathway of Joe Biden of thumping our

40:16
chest and pretending that the president of the United States's words mattered more than the president of the United States's actions what makes America a good country is America engaging in diplomacy that's what president Trump is doing can I ask you sure yeah yeah okay so he

40:35
cupied uh our parts big parts of Ukraine part of East and Crimea uh so he occupied it on 2014 so during a lot of years I'm not speaking about just Biden but those time was Obama then President Obama then president Trump then president bid now president Trump and God bless now

41:01
president Trump will stop him but during 2014 nobody stopped him he just occupied and took he killed people you know what the contact are 2015 2014 2014 201 2014 yeah so I was not here yeah exactly right yes but during 2014 till 2022 yeah the was the situation the same

41:23
that people are been dying on the contact line nobody stopped him you know that we had conversations with him a lot of conversation my bilateral conversation and we signed with him me like a new president in 2019 I signed with him the deal I signed with him macron and Merkel we sign ceasefire

41:47
ceasefire all of them told me that he will never go we signed him with guas contract guas contract yes but after that he broken this his fire he killed our people and he didn't exchange prisoners we signed the exchange of prisoners but he didn't do it what kind of diplomacy JD you are speaking about

42:10
what what you what you what do you mean I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country Mr President Mr President with respect I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the

42:22
American Media right now you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you have Manpower problems you should be thanking the president for trying to bring it into this conflict you ever been to Ukraine that you say what problems we have I have been to I've actually I've

42:39
actually watched and seen the stories and I know what happens is you bring people you bring them on a propaganda tour Mr President are do you disagree that you've had problems bringing people into your military and do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval

42:54
Office of the United States of America and attack the ad ation that is trying to trying to prevent the destruction of your country a lot of a lot of questions let's start from the beginning first of all during the war everybody has problems even you but you have nice

43:09
ocean and don't feel now but you will feel it in the future God bless you don't know that God bless God bless you will not have War don't tell us what we're going to feel we're trying to solve a problem don't tell us what we're going to feel I'm not telling you

43:24
because you're in no position to dictate that position to dictate what we're going to feel we're going to feel very good feel influ we're going to feel very good and very strong will feel influence you're right now not in a very good position you've allowed yourself to be in a very

43:41
bad position and he happens to be right about from the very beginning of the war you're not in a good position you don't have the cards right now with us you start having cards right now you don't you're playing card you're you're gambling with the lives of millions of

43:57
people you're gambling with World War I you're gambling with World War I and what you're doing is very dis disrespectful to the country this country that's back to you far more than a lot of people said they should have have you said thank you once this entire meeting no in this entire meeting have

44:16
you said thank you you went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who's trying to save your country please you think that if you will speak very loudly about the war you

44:35
can he's not speaking loudly he's not speaking loudly your country is in big trouble can I wait a minute no no you've done a lot of talking your country is in big trouble I know you're not winning you're not winning this you have a damn good chance of coming out okay because

44:50
of us Mr President we are staying in our country staying strong from the very beginning of the war we've been alone and we are thankful I said you haven't beenin you Haven we gave you through this stupid president $350 billion we gave you military equipment and your men

45:07
are brave but they had to use our military if you didn't have our military equipment inv if you didn't have our military equipment this war would have been over in two weeks in three days I heard it from Putin in three days this is something may in two weeks of course

45:24
yes it's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this just say thank you except except except that there are disagreements and let's go litigate those disagreements rather than trying to fight it out in the American Media when you're wrong we know that you're

45:41
wrong but you see I think it's good for the American people to see what's going on I think it's very important that's why I kept this going so long you have to be thankful you don't have the cards you're buried there you're people are dying you're running low on solders listen you're running low

45:59
on soldiers it would be a damn good thing and then you then you tell us I don't want to cease fire I don't want to ceas fire I want to go and I want to this I look if you could get a ceasefire right now I tell you you take it so the bullets stop Flying and you men stuff

46:14
getting kill course of course we want to stop the war but I saying you don't want a ceas I want a ceas GU because you'll get a ceasefire faster than a degree ask our people about she fire what they think that wasn't doesn't matter for you what wasn't with me that was with a guy

46:30
named Biden who was not a smart person that was that was with ob it was your brother excuse me that was with Obama who gave you sheets and I gave you javelins yes I gave you the javelins to take out all those tanks Obama gave you sheets in fact the statement is Obama gave sheets and Trump gave

46:50
javelins you got to be more thankful because let me tell you you don't have the cards with us you have the cards but without us you don't have any cards one more question to Mr Vice President I'm sorry going to be a tough deal to make because the attitudes have to change

47:08
what if Russia breaks this fire what if Russia breaks these talks what is understand what are you saying she's asking what if Russia breaks the ceasefire what if they what if anything what if a bomb drops on your head right now okay why did they broke it I don't know they broke it with Biden because

47:30
Biden they didn't respect him they didn't respect Obama they respect me let me tell you Putin went through a hell of a lot with me he went through a phony Witch Hunt where they used him and Russia Russia Russia Russia you ever hear of that deal that was a phony that

47:46
was a phony Hunter Biden Joe Biden scam Hillary Clinton Shifty Adam shiff it was a Democrat scam and he had to go through that and he did go through it we didn't end up in a war and he went through it he was accused of all that stuff he had nothing to do with it came out a hunter

48:05
Biden's bathroom it came out of Hunter Biden's bedroom it was disgusting and then they said oh oh the laptop from hell was made by Russia the 51 agents the whole thing was a scam and he had to put up with that he was being accused of all that stuff all I can say is this he

48:27
might have broken deals with Obama and Bush and he might have broken them with Biden he did maybe maybe he didn't I don't know what happened but he didn't break him with me he wants to make a deal I don't know if you can make a deal the problem is I've empowered you to be

48:43
a tough guy and I don't think you'd be a tough guy without the United States and your people are very brave but you're either going to make a deal or we're out and if we're out you'll fight it out I don't think it's going to be pretty but you'll fight it out but you don't have

48:60
the cards but once we sign that deal you're in a much better position but you're not acting at all thankful and that's not a nice thing I'll be honest that's not a nice thing all right uh I think we've seen enough what do you think this is this is going to be great television I will say

49:18
that all right we'll see what we can do we'll see
